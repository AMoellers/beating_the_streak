Some people may only make a couple selections a week, while others may choose two batters every day. Some people may base their choices on statistics like batting average (BA) or earned run average (ERA), while others may look at expected batting average (xBA) or walk rate (BB%). Additionally, keen contestants may consider others factors like weather or bullpen composition.\nThese are some of the variables that I consider when making BTS predictions, sorted roughly by most to least important.\n\nBatter strength (high xBA, low BB%)\nStarting pitcher strength (high xBA, low BB%, low K%)\nPark factors\nBatter / starting pitcher matchup (handedness, history)\nElemental factors (temperature, wind, humidity)\nBullpen strength & availability\nLineup position\n\nI also generally select two batters every day using the “Double Down Feature”."

Since simulation will be done on the 2024 season, the model will use data from 2021 through 2023.\nSome variables will have a greater impact than others, and this can be quantified by the estimate and p-values for each term.

Since this information would not be available to someone making their 2024 selections, the player’s 250 AB rolling xBA will be used as an estimate in the simulations.\nWith recalculated probabilities, sets of selections can be generated with the same information that would be available to contestants during the 2024 BTS contest. Before that, here is a look at the distribution of hit probabilities for the 2024 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Histogram of hit probabilities for all possible selections in the 2024 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor analysis, 15,000 sets of selections are simulated. Selections are made with the following criteria:\n\nTwo batters will be selected each day.\nOnly batters with a hit probability of at least 67.5% will be eligible for selection.\nThe chance that a batter is selected is proportional to their hit probability. E.g. a batter with a hit probability of 0.75 is 50% more likely to be selected than a batter with a hit probability of 0.50.\n\nIn the simulations, these were the most selected batters, pitchers, and parks. The list of batters is unsurprisingly correlated to batters with a high xBA. Juan Soto, Bobby Witt Jr., and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. were the top three batters by xBA in 2024. Similarly, the pitchers on this list all had a high xBA in 2024, but there is a bias towards Rockies pitchers since they pitch half their games at Coors Field, which is by far the most selected park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatters\n\n\nbatter\nn\n\n\n\n\nJuan Soto\n100962\n\n\nBobby Witt Jr.\n94620\n\n\nLuis Arráez\n90838\n\n\nVladimir Guerrero\n86775\n\n\nAlec Bohm\n85070\n\n\nMarcell Ozuna\n82035\n\n\nYainer Diaz\n77167\n\n\nYordan Álvarez\n76824\n\n\nAaron Judge\n76349\n\n\nShohei Ohtani\n74289\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPitchers\n\n\npitcher\nn\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Corbin\n114411\n\n\nAustin Gomber\n111107\n\n\nCal Quantrill\n108909\n\n\nLogan Webb\n97029\n\n\nRyan Feltner\n81491\n\n\nMacKenzie Gore\n80835\n\n\nRyne Nelson\n78516\n\n\nChris Flexen\n78252\n\n\nDakota Hudson\n73554\n\n\nMiles Mikolas\n73071\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPark\n\n\npark\nn\n\n\n\n\nCOL\n474777\n\n\nKCA\n321821\n\n\nARI\n312640\n\n\nWAS\n302927\n\n\nBOS\n281048\n\n\nPHI\n236432\n\n\nHOU\n233940\n\n\nSDN\n228595\n\n\nSLN\n221624\n\n\nATL\n202143\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sad reality of BTS is that even with a “decent” strategy, most contestants will top out at a streak of between 10 and 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Bar graph of the longest streaks for simulated selections of the 2024 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the reality even though contestants can reasonably maintain a success rate of 70% or higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Histogram of success rates for simulated selections of the 2024 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s well understood that the average contestant is extremely unlikely to even come close to the 57 hit-streak goal, but what was the longest streak of the 15,000 simulations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Stairstep plot of the current streak for the best simulation of the 2024 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best simulation was able to reach a streak of 48, well short of the 57 necessary to claim the grand prize."
